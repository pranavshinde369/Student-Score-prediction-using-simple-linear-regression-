# 📘 Student Score Prediction Using Simple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to build a **Simple Linear Regression** model to predict student exam scores based on the **number of hours studied**. The dataset used is realistic and contains natural variations, making the model practical and closer to real-world use cases.

---

## 📂 Dataset
**File:** `student_scores_real.csv`  
**Rows:** 38  
**Columns:**  
- `Hours` → Hours studied  
- `Scores` → Exam score

## 🎯 Objective
To predict the exam score of a student based on the number of hours they studied using a simple linear regression model.

---

## 🧠 Key Steps
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Visualize Hours vs Scores  
3. Train-Test split  
4. Train the Linear Regression model  
5. Model Evaluation  
6. Prediction for custom input hours

## 🧪 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-Learn  

---

## 📊 Visualizations
Includes:
- Scatter Plot (Hours vs Scores)  
- Regression Line Plot  

---

## 🧮 Evaluation Metrics
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)  
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)  
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)  
- R² Score  

---

## 📈 Example Prediction
Enter study hours → Model predicts expected exam score.

## 📁 Files Included
- `linear_regression_student_scores.ipynb` → Full project notebook  
- `student_scores_real.csv` → Dataset  
 

---

## ⭐ Conclusion
This project shows how study hours positively influence exam performance.  
Linear regression provides a strong baseline model for educational analytics.
